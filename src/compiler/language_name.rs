 * Components:
 * Lexical analyser - Read the written code from a file, split it into usable tokens
 * Syntax analyser - Ensure the written code tokens are used correctly
 * Semantic analyser - Ensure the code correctly uses types, operators, functions, variables, etc.
 * Intermediate Generation - Build a simple version of the code, that can be easily translated
 * Optimisation - find generic ways to improve the generated code
 * Generation - Build the optimised code into a program that can be run
